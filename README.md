`sai` is a simple single-collateral stablecoin that is dependent on a
trusted oracle and has a kill-switch.

There are three tokens in the system:

- `gem`: externally valuable token e.g. ETH
- `skr`: a claim to locked `gem`s
- `sai`: the stablecoin, a variable claim on some quantity of `gem`s

Collateral holders deposit their collateral using `join` and receive
`skr` tokens proportional to their deposit. `skr` can be redeemed for
collateral with `exit`. You will get more or less `gem` tokens for each
`skr` depending whether the system made a profit or loss while you
were exposed.

The oracle updates the GEM:REF price feed using `mark`. This is the only
external real-time input to the system.

`skr` is used as the direct backing collateral for CDPs. A prospective
issuer can `open` an empty position, `lock` some `skr` and then `draw`
some `sai`. Debt is covered with `wipe`. Collateral can be reclaimed
with `free` as long as the CDP remains "safe".

If the value of the collateral backing the CDP falls below the
liquidation ratio `mat`, the CDP is vulnerable to liquidation via
`bite`. On liquidation, the CDP `skr` collateral is sold off to cover
the `sai` debt.

Under-collateralized CDPs can be liquidated with `bite`. Liquidation is
immediate: backing `skr` is taken to cover the `sai` debt at the time of
`bite`, plus a liquidation fee (`axe`); any excess remains in the CDP.

`skr` seized from bad CDPs can be purchased with `bust`, in exchange for
`sai` at the current feed price. This `sai` pays down the bad CDP debt.

### Settlement

`sai` can be shut down at a given price with `cage`, after which `sai`
and `skr` can be exchanged for `gems` via `cash`. All outstanding `cups`
are liquidated and the *entire pool* of `gem` is tapped to redeem `sai`
at their face value, as if the boom/bust trades were instantly settled
at the cage price.  Any remaining `gems` are shared between `skr`
holders.

Practically this means that if the system is undercollateralized on
`cage`, holders of free `skr` will have their `gem` share diluted as
much as necessary to make `sai` whole. *`skr` is a risk bearing token*.

Excess collateral contained within a single `cup` can be reclaimed with
`bail(cup)`.
